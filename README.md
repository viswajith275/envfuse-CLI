## Problem & Solution

### The Problem

Developers often struggle with securely managing API keys, tokens, and sensitive credentials:

- **Plain-text storage**: Keeping secrets in `.env` files or shell scripts exposes them to accidental commits and unauthorized access
- **Manual management**: Switching between different API keys for different environments is tedious and error-prone
- **No encryption**: Standard environment variable management lacks built-in encryption
- **Security breaches**: A single compromised machine can expose all stored credentials if they're not encrypted
- **Scattered secrets**: API keys scattered across multiple config files are hard to audit and manage

### The Solution

**envfuse-CLI** provides:

✅ **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using military-grade encryption  
✅ **Master Password Protection**: Vault locked behind a single, strong master password  
✅ **Easy Secret Management**: Simple commands to set, get, and manage secrets  
✅ **Shell Integration**: Seamlessly load encrypted secrets into your shell environment  
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux (x86_64), macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon)  
✅ **Password Derivation**: Uses Argon2 for secure password hashing  
✅ **Memory Safety**: Built in Rust with automatic memory wiping to prevent secret leaks

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Your Vault

Run the initialization command and set a strong master password:

```bash
envfuse init
```

Output:
```
                                /$$$$$$
                               /$$__  $$
  /$$$$$$  /$$$$$$$  /$$    /$$| $$  \__//$$   /$$  /$$$$$$$  /$$$$$$
 /$$__  $$| $$__  $$|  $$  /$$/| $$$$   | $$  | $$ /$$_____/ /$$__  $$
| $$$$$$$$| $$  \ $$ \  $$/$$/ | $$_/   | $$  | $$|  $$$$$$ | $$$$$$$$
| $$_____/| $$  | $$  \  $$$/  | $$     | $$  | $$ \____  $$| $$_____/
|  $$$$$$$| $$  | $$   \  $/   | $$     |  $$$$$$/ /$$$$$$$/|  $$$$$$$
 \_______/|__/  |__/    \_/    |__/      \______/ |_______/  \_______/

Set a master password: ••••••••••
Confirm master password: ••••••••••
Vault created at /Users/username/.config/envfuse/vault-encrypted.json
```

### 2. Store a Secret

```bash
envfuse set GITHUB_TOKEN
# Enter your GitHub token when prompted
```

### 3. Retrieve a Secret

```bash
envfuse get GITHUB_TOKEN
# Outputs your GitHub token (requires master password)
```

### 4. Load Secrets into Your Shell

```bash
eval "$(envfuse load GITHUB_TOKEN DATABASE_URL API_KEY)"
```

This will prompt for your master password once and load all specified secrets as environment variables in your current shell session.

### 5. List All Stored Secrets

```bash
envfuse list
# Shows all secret names (not their values)
```

### 6. Remove a Secret

```bash
envfuse remove GITHUB_TOKEN
# Removes the secret from the vault
```

---

## Commands

### `envfuse init`

Initialize a new encrypted vault with a master password.

```bash
envfuse init
```

- Creates an encrypted vault file in your OS config directory
- Prompts for master password setup and confirmation
- Validates password strength (recommend 12+ characters)

**Storage location:**
- Linux: `~/.config/envfuse/vault-encrypted.json`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/envfuse/vault-encrypted.json`

---

### `envfuse set <KEY>`

Store a new secret or update an existing one.

```bash
envfuse set GITHUB_TOKEN
# Or with a value directly:
envfuse set DATABASE_URL "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db"
```

- Prompts for master password
- Encrypts and stores the secret
- Automatically creates/updates the vault

---

### `envfuse get <KEY>`

Retrieve a stored secret.

```bash
envfuse get GITHUB_TOKEN
```

- Prompts for master password

- Returns error if the key doesn't exist

---

### `envfuse load <KEYS...>`

Load multiple secrets into your shell environment.

```bash
envfuse load GITHUB_TOKEN DATABASE_URL API_KEY
```

- Prompts for master password (once)
- Outputs shell export commands
- Use with `eval` to set environment variables:

```bash
eval "$(envfuse load GITHUB_TOKEN DATABASE_URL)"
```

**Usage in scripts:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
eval "$(envfuse load DATABASE_URL API_KEY)"
echo $DATABASE_URL  # Access loaded secrets
```

---

### `envfuse list`

List all stored secret names.

```bash
envfuse list
```

- Prompts for master password
- Shows all keys in your vault
- Does not display secret values

---

### `envfuse remove <KEY>`

Delete a secret from the vault.

```bash
envfuse remove GITHUB_TOKEN
```

- Prompts for master password

- Returns error if the key doesn't exist

---

## Security

### Encryption Details

envfuse-CLI uses industry-standard encryption:

- **Cipher**: AES-256-GCM (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)
- **Key Derivation**: Argon2 (memory-hard password hashing)
- **Random Nonce**: 12-byte randomly generated nonce per encryption
- **Salt**: 16-byte random salt for key derivation
- **Authenticated Tags**: Each encrypted value includes authentication tags to prevent tampering

### Security Best Practices

1. **Use a Strong Master Password**
   - At least 12 characters
   - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
   - Avoid dictionary words and personal information

2. **Protect Your Vault File**
   - The vault file is encrypted but should still be protected
   - Use full-disk encryption on your machine
   - Don't back up the vault file to unsecured locations
   - Keep your machine secure and up-to-date

3. **Be Careful When Loading Secrets**
   - Only load secrets you need for a specific task
   - Avoid loading secrets into long-running shell sessions unnecessarily
   - Be cautious with the `eval` command—only use with trusted vault data

4. **Master Password**
   - Never share your master password
   - Consider using a password manager to store it securely
   - Change it periodically for added security

### Memory Safety

- Written in Rust with memory safety guarantees
- Sensitive data is automatically wiped from memory after use via the `zeroize` crate
- No garbage collection delays that could expose secrets
- Stack-based encryption operations reduce timing attack surface

### Vault File Format

The vault file (`vault-encrypted.json`) contains:
- **salt**: Randomly generated salt (Base64-encoded)
- **canary**: Encrypted test data to verify password correctness
- **entries**: Your encrypted secrets (Base64-encoded nonce + ciphertext pairs)

The file itself is not encrypted at the file-system level; rely on:
- Full-disk encryption
- File permissions (`chmod 600`)
- Your operating system's access controls

## Use Cases

### Development Workflow

Store API keys used in development:

```bash
# Initialize once
envfuse init

# Store your development secrets
envfuse set GITHUB_TOKEN
envfuse set OPENAI_API_KEY
envfuse set DATABASE_URL

# Load them when needed
eval "$(envfuse load GITHUB_TOKEN OPENAI_API_KEY DATABASE_URL)"

# Use in your application
npm start  # Your app can now access these env vars
```

### CI/CD Secrets (Local Testing)

Test CI scripts locally with real secrets:

```bash
# Load secrets for testing
eval "$(envfuse load DEPLOY_KEY AWS_ACCESS_KEY)"
./deploy.sh
```

### Multiple Environment Management

Store secrets for different environments:

```bash
# Development
envfuse set DEV_DATABASE_URL
envfuse set DEV_API_KEY

# Staging
envfuse set STAGING_DATABASE_URL
envfuse set STAGING_API_KEY

# Production
envfuse set PROD_DATABASE_URL
envfuse set PROD_API_KEY

# Load environment-specific secrets
eval "$(envfuse load DEV_DATABASE_URL DEV_API_KEY)"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Vault not found" Error

**Problem**: `envfuse: error: no vault found — run 'envfuse init' first`

**Solution**: Initialize your vault:
```bash
envfuse init
```

### "Wrong Master Password" Error

**Problem**: `envfuse: error: wrong master password`

**Solution**: 
- Ensure you're entering the correct master password
- Check for CAPS LOCK or other input issues
- If forgotten, you'll need to reinitialize (data cannot be recovered)

### "No entry named X" Error

**Problem**: `envfuse: error: no entry named 'SOME_KEY'`

**Solution**:
- Check the exact spelling: `envfuse list` shows all available keys
- Keys are case-sensitive
- Make sure you've stored the key first: `envfuse set SOME_KEY`

### Installation Path Issues

**Problem**: `envfuse: command not found` after installation

**Solution**:
- Verify installation: `which envfuse` or `echo $PATH`
- Add to PATH in your shell config:
  ```bash
  export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
  ```
- Reload shell: `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`

### Permission Denied

**Problem**: `Permission denied` when running envfuse

**Solution**:
```bash
chmod +x /path/to/envfuse
# Then run it again
```
