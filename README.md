## Problem & Solution

### The Problem

Developers often struggle with securely managing API keys, tokens, and sensitive credentials:

* **Plain-text storage**: Keeping secrets in `.env` files or shell scripts exposes them to accidental commits and unauthorized access
* **Manual management**: Switching between different API keys for different environments is tedious and error-prone
* **No encryption**: Standard environment variable management lacks built-in encryption
* **Security breaches**: A single compromised machine can expose all stored credentials if they're not encrypted
* **Scattered secrets**: API keys scattered across multiple config files are hard to audit and manage

### The Solution

**EnvSeal** provides:

✅ **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using military-grade encryption
✅ **Master Password Protection**: Vault locked behind a single, strong master password
✅ **Easy Secret Management**: Simple commands to set, get, and manage secrets
✅ **Automatic Shell Integration**: The installer wires up a shell function so `envseal load` "just works" — no manual `eval` needed
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux (x86_64), macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), with bash, zsh, and fish support
✅ **Password Derivation**: Uses Argon2 for secure password hashing
✅ **Memory Safety**: Built in Rust with automatic memory wiping to prevent secret leaks

---

## Features

* **End-to-End Encryption**: Secrets encrypted with AES-256-GCM
* **Master Password Protection**: Single master password protects all secrets
* **Lightweight Binary**: Single compiled executable, no dependencies required
* **Fast**: Written in Rust for blazing-fast performance
* **Memory Safe**: Automatic memory wiping prevents sensitive data leaks
* **Zero-Friction Shell Integration**: Load secrets directly into your bash/zsh/fish environment with a single command — no `eval` boilerplate required
* **Simple CLI**: Intuitive commands for managing secrets
* **OS-Aware Storage**: Vault stored in standard config directory for your OS

---

## Installation

Choose your preferred installation method. All methods below always install the **latest** release unless you pass a specific version — so these commands never need to be edited when a new version ships.

### Method 1: Automated Installation (Recommended)

Download and run the installation script. This always fetches the install script attached to the *latest* GitHub release, so the command below stays correct forever — you never need to update a version number in it:

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/viswajith275/EnvSeal-CLI/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash

```

The installer will:

* Auto-detect your OS and architecture
* Download the matching pre-compiled binary (latest release, by default)
* Add the binary to your PATH
* Set up automatic shell integration for **bash**, **zsh**, and **fish**

You can customize the install with flags, passed after `-s --`:

```bash
# Install to a custom directory
curl -sSL https://github.com/viswajith275/EnvSeal-CLI/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s -- --dir /usr/local/bin

# Pin to a specific version instead of latest
curl -sSL https://github.com/viswajith275/EnvSeal-CLI/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s -- --version v1.0.1

```

> Note: `--version` controls which release of the **binary** is downloaded. The install script itself is always pulled from `releases/latest`, since the script's own logic rarely changes between versions.

### Method 2: Manual Installation via Release Artifacts

1. **Download the binary** for your platform from the [latest release](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/viswajith275/EnvSeal/releases/latest):
* `envseal-macos-x86_64.tar.gz` (macOS Intel)
* `envseal-macos-aarch64.tar.gz` (macOS Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3)
* `envseal-linux-musl-x86_64.tar.gz` (Linux x86_64)


2. **Extract and install**:
```bash
# Extract the archive
tar -xzf envseal-*.tar.gz

# Move to your PATH
mv envseal-* ~/.local/bin/envseal
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/envseal

# Ensure ~/.local/bin is in your PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

```


3. **Add to your shell config** (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `~/.config/fish/config.fish`):
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"          # bash / zsh
# fish_add_path $HOME/.local/bin               # fish

```


With a manual install you'll also miss the automatic `envseal load` shell wrapper (see [Load Secrets into Your Shell](https://www.google.com/search?q=%234-load-secrets-into-your-shell)). If you want that convenience, use Method 1 or Method 4 instead, or use `eval "$(envseal load ...)"` directly.
4. **Reload your shell**:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc                              # bash
source ~/.zshrc                                # zsh
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish              # fish

```



### Method 3: Build from Source

Prerequisites:

* [Rust 1.70+](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* `cargo`

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/viswajith275/EnvSeal-CLI.git
cd EnvSeal

# Build the release binary
cargo build --release

# Verify installation
./target/release/envseal --version

```

To get the automatic shell integration (PATH + the `envseal load` wrapper function) after building from source, run the install script against your local binary — see Method 4 below.

### Method 4: Using the Installation Script with a Local Binary

If you've built the binary locally or already have a pre-built binary or tarball downloaded, point the installer at it directly. This skips the network download entirely but still sets up your PATH and shell integration:

```bash
# From a locally-built binary
./install.sh --file ./target/release/envseal

# From a downloaded tarball
./install.sh --file ~/Downloads/envseal-macos-aarch64.tar.gz

```

### Verify Installation

```bash
envseal --help

```

You should see the available commands and options.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Your Vault

Run the initialization command and set a strong master password:

```bash
envseal init

```

Output:

```
 /$$$$$$$$                       /$$$$$$                      /$$
| $$_____/                      /$$__  $$                    | $$
| $$       /$$$$$$$  /$$    /$$| $$  \__/  /$$$$$$   /$$$$$$ | $$
| $$$$$   | $$__  $$|  $$  /$$/|  $$$$$$  /$$__  $$ |____  $$| $$
| $$__/   | $$  \ $$ \  $$/$$/  \____  $$| $$$$$$$$  /$$$$$$$| $$
| $$      | $$  | $$  \  $$$/   /$$  \ $$| $$_____/ /$$__  $$| $$
| $$$$$$$$| $$  | $$   \  $/   |  $$$$$$/|  $$$$$$$|  $$$$$$$| $$
|________/|__/  |__/    \_/     \______/  \_______/ \_______/|__/

Set a master password: ••••••••••
Confirm master password: ••••••••••
Vault created at /Users/username/.config/envseal/vault-encrypted.json

```

### 2. Store a Secret

```bash
envseal set GITHUB_TOKEN
# Enter your GitHub token when prompted

```

### 3. Retrieve a Secret

```bash
envseal get GITHUB_TOKEN
# Outputs your GitHub token (requires master password)

```

### 4. Load Secrets into Your Shell

If you installed via Method 1 or Method 4, the installer already added an `envseal()` shell function to your `.bashrc` / `.zshrc` / `fish` config. That function automatically detects the `load` subcommand and applies its output to your current shell — **no `eval` needed**:

```bash
envseal load GITHUB_TOKEN DATABASE_URL API_KEY

```

This prompts for your master password once and exports all specified secrets as environment variables directly into your current shell session.

If you installed manually (Method 2 or Method 3) and skipped shell integration, or you're calling the real binary explicitly (e.g. `command envseal`), fall back to the manual form:

```bash
eval "$(envseal load GITHUB_TOKEN DATABASE_URL API_KEY)"

```

**Usage in scripts** (always use the explicit `eval` form here, since scripts may not source your interactive shell config):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
eval "$(envseal load DATABASE_URL API_KEY)"
echo $DATABASE_URL  # Access loaded secrets

```

### 5. List All Stored Secrets

```bash
envseal list
# Shows all secret names (not their values)

```

### 6. Remove a Secret

```bash
envseal remove GITHUB_TOKEN
# Removes the secret from the vault

```

---

## Commands

### `envseal init`

Initialize a new encrypted vault with a master password.

```bash
envseal init

```

* Creates an encrypted vault file in your OS config directory
* Prompts for master password setup and confirmation
* Validates password strength (recommend 12+ characters)

**Storage location:**

* Linux: `~/.config/envseal/vault-encrypted.json`
* macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/envseal/vault-encrypted.json`

---

### `envseal set <KEY>`

Store a new secret or update an existing one.

```bash
envseal set GITHUB_TOKEN
# Or with a value directly:
envseal set DATABASE_URL "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db"

```

* Prompts for master password
* Encrypts and stores the secret
* Automatically creates/updates the vault

---

### `envseal get <KEY>`

Retrieve a stored secret.

```bash
envseal get GITHUB_TOKEN

```

* Prompts for master password
* Decrypts and displays the secret
* Returns error if the key doesn't exist

---

### `envseal load <KEYS...>`

Load multiple secrets into your shell environment.

```bash
envseal load GITHUB_TOKEN DATABASE_URL API_KEY

```

* Prompts for master password (once)
* Outputs shell export commands
* If you used the automated installer, calling `envseal load ...` directly in an interactive bash/zsh/fish session already applies the exports — the wrapper function runs `eval` for you.
* Otherwise, wrap it with `eval` yourself:

```bash
eval "$(envseal load GITHUB_TOKEN DATABASE_URL)"

```

**Usage in scripts:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
eval "$(envseal load DATABASE_URL API_KEY)"
echo $DATABASE_URL  # Access loaded secrets

```

---

### `envseal list`

List all stored secret names.

```bash
envseal list

```

* Prompts for master password
* Shows all keys in your vault
* Does not display secret values

---

### `envseal remove <KEY>`

Delete a secret from the vault.

```bash
envseal remove GITHUB_TOKEN

```

* Prompts for master password
* Removes the specified key
* Returns error if the key doesn't exist

---

## Security

### Encryption Details

EnvSeal uses industry-standard encryption:

* **Cipher**: AES-256-GCM (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)
* **Key Derivation**: Argon2 (memory-hard password hashing)
* **Random Nonce**: 12-byte randomly generated nonce per encryption
* **Salt**: 16-byte random salt for key derivation
* **Authenticated Tags**: Each encrypted value includes authentication tags to prevent tampering

### Security Best Practices

1. **Use a Strong Master Password**
* At least 12 characters
* Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
* Avoid dictionary words and personal information


2. **Protect Your Vault File**
* The vault file is encrypted but should still be protected
* Use full-disk encryption on your machine
* Don't back up the vault file to unsecured locations
* Keep your machine secure and up-to-date


3. **Be Careful When Loading Secrets**
* Only load secrets you need for a specific task
* Avoid loading secrets into long-running shell sessions unnecessarily
* The automatic `envseal load` shell integration only runs `eval` on output from the real `envseal` binary invoked via `command`, so it can't recurse into itself — but you should still only install EnvSeal from sources you trust


4. **Master Password**
* Never share your master password
* Consider using a password manager to store it securely
* Change it periodically for added security



### Memory Safety

* Written in Rust with memory safety guarantees
* Sensitive data is automatically wiped from memory after use via the `zeroize` crate
* No garbage collection delays that could expose secrets
* Stack-based encryption operations reduce timing attack surface

### Vault File Format

The vault file (`vault-encrypted.json`) contains:

* **salt**: Randomly generated salt (Base64-encoded)
* **canary**: Encrypted test data to verify password correctness
* **entries**: Your encrypted secrets (Base64-encoded nonce + ciphertext pairs)

The file itself is not encrypted at the file-system level; rely on:

* Full-disk encryption
* File permissions (`chmod 600`)
* Your operating system's access controls

---

## Use Cases

### Development Workflow

Store API keys used in development:

```bash
# Initialize once
envseal init

# Store your development secrets
envseal set GITHUB_TOKEN
envseal set OPENAI_API_KEY
envseal set DATABASE_URL

# Load them when needed (no eval needed with the automated installer)
envseal load GITHUB_TOKEN OPENAI_API_KEY DATABASE_URL

# Use in your application
npm start  # Your app can now access these env vars

```

### CI/CD Secrets (Local Testing)

Test CI scripts locally with real secrets. In non-interactive scripts, always use the explicit `eval` form since the shell wrapper only applies to interactive sessions sourced from your rc file:

```bash
eval "$(envseal load DEPLOY_KEY AWS_ACCESS_KEY)"
./deploy.sh

```

### Multiple Environment Management

Store secrets for different environments:

```bash
# Development
envseal set DEV_DATABASE_URL
envseal set DEV_API_KEY

# Staging
envseal set STAGING_DATABASE_URL
envseal set STAGING_API_KEY

# Production
envseal set PROD_DATABASE_URL
envseal set PROD_API_KEY

# Load environment-specific secrets
envseal load DEV_DATABASE_URL DEV_API_KEY

```

## Troubleshooting

### "Vault not found" Error

**Problem**: `envseal: error: no vault found — run 'envseal init' first`

**Solution**: Initialize your vault:

```bash
envseal init

```

### "Wrong Master Password" Error

**Problem**: `envseal: error: wrong master password`

**Solution**:

* Ensure you're entering the correct master password
* Check for CAPS LOCK or other input issues
* If forgotten, you'll need to reinitialize (data cannot be recovered)

### "No entry named X" Error

**Problem**: `envseal: error: no entry named 'SOME_KEY'`

**Solution**:

* Check the exact spelling: `envseal list` shows all available keys
* Keys are case-sensitive
* Make sure you've stored the key first: `envseal set SOME_KEY`

### Installation Path Issues

**Problem**: `envseal: command not found` after installation

**Solution**:

* Verify installation: `which envseal` or `echo $PATH`
* Add to PATH manually if needed:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"          # bash / zsh
fish_add_path $HOME/.local/bin                 # fish

```


* Reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc                               # bash
source ~/.zshrc                                 # zsh
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish                # fish

```



### `envseal load` isn't setting environment variables in my shell

**Problem**: Running `envseal load KEY` prints export statements but they don't seem to take effect.

**Solution**: This means the automatic shell wrapper wasn't installed or wasn't loaded into your current session:

* Confirm the wrapper exists: `type envseal` should show a shell function, not just a binary path
* If it only shows the binary path, re-run the installer (Method 1 or Method 4) or restart your shell/terminal
* As an immediate workaround, use the explicit form: `eval "$(envseal load KEY)"`

### Permission Denied

**Problem**: `Permission denied` when running envseal

**Solution**:

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/envseal
# Then run it again

```
