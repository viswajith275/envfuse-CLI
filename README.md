A lightweight, encrypted command-line vault for securely managing API keys, secrets, and sensitive environment variables on your local machine. EnvSeal organizes your secrets into **groups** (like `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`) so you can seamlessly switch environments or inject secrets directly into application processes.

**Version:** see [Releases](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/viswajith275/EnvSeal-CLI/releases) for the current version and changelog.

## Problem & Solution

### The Problem

Developers often struggle with securely managing API keys, tokens, and sensitive credentials:

* **Plain-text storage**: Keeping secrets in `.env` files or shell scripts exposes them to accidental commits and unauthorized access.
* **Environment sprawl**: Switching between different API keys for different environments (dev, staging, prod) is tedious and error-prone.
* **Global scope leaks**: Loading secrets into your global terminal session means any background script can access them.
* **Scattered secrets**: API keys scattered across multiple config files are hard to audit and manage.

### The Solution

**EnvSeal** provides:

✅ **Group-Based Management**: Organize secrets into environments (e.g., `dev`, `prod`) and switch seamlessly.
✅ **Secure Process Injection**: Use `envseal run` to inject secrets only into a specific child process without exposing them to your terminal session.
✅ **End-to-End Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using military-grade AES-256-GCM.
✅ **Master Password Protection**: The vault is locked behind a single, strong master password (derived via Argon2).
✅ **Drop-in `.env` Replacement**: Easily import existing `.env` files or export groups back out.
✅ **Memory Safety**: Built in Rust with automatic memory wiping to prevent secret leaks.

## Features

* **Group Organization**: Group your variables by project or environment (creates groups automatically on first set).
* **Child Process Execution**: Safely run applications with decrypted variables injected directly into their environment.
* **Bulk Import/Export**: Instantly parse `.env` files into encrypted groups, or output groups to `.env` format.
* **End-to-End Encryption**: Secrets encrypted with AES-256-GCM.
* **Memory Safe**: Automatic memory wiping prevents sensitive data leaks.
* **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), with support for bash, zsh, and fish.

## Installation

Choose your preferred installation method.

### Method 1: Automated Installation (Recommended)

Download and run the installation script. This always fetches the install script attached to the *latest* GitHub release.

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viswajith275/envseal-cli/master/install.sh | bash

```

The installer will auto-detect your OS and architecture, download the matching binary, add it to your PATH, and set up automatic shell integration for `envseal load`.

### Method 2: Build from Source

Prerequisites: [Rust 1.70+](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and `cargo`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/viswajith275/EnvSeal-CLI.git
cd EnvSeal
cargo build --release

# Move to your PATH
mv target/release/envseal ~/.local/bin/envseal
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/envseal

```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Your Vault

Run the initialization command and set a strong master password:

```bash
envseal init

```

### 2. Store Secrets in a Group

Store your development secrets in a group named `dev` (the group is created automatically):

```bash
envseal set dev DATABASE_URL
# Prompts for master password and the secret value

```

### 3. Import an Existing `.env` File

Migrate a plain-text `.env` file into an encrypted group named `prod`:

```bash
envseal import prod .env.production

```

### 4. Run an Application Safely

Inject your group's secrets directly into a process without leaking them to the terminal:

```bash
envseal run dev npm start

```

*(This is the recommended workflow. It prompts for your master password once, decrypts the variables, and executes `npm start` with those variables injected.)*

---

## Commands

### `envseal init`

Initialize a new encrypted vault with a master password.

* Creates an encrypted vault file in your OS config directory (`~/.config/dev.envseal.envseal/seal-encrypted.json`).
* Prompts for master password setup and confirmation.

### `envseal set <GROUP_NAME> <KEY>`

Set or update a value for a given key in a group. If the group doesn't exist, it is created.

```bash
envseal set dev GITHUB_TOKEN

```

### `envseal get <GROUP_NAME> <KEY>`

Retrieve a stored secret from a specific group.

```bash
envseal get dev GITHUB_TOKEN

```

### `envseal import <GROUP_NAME> <PATH_OF_.ENV>`

Reads a `.env` file and securely loads all key-value pairs into the specified vault group.

```bash
envseal import staging /path/to/staging.env

```

### `envseal export <GROUP_NAME> > .env`

Decrypts and outputs the entire group in standard `.env` format. You can pipe this directly into a file.

```bash
envseal export prod > .env.production

```

### `envseal run <GROUP_NAME> <COMMAND>`

**(Recommended)** Loads the environment variables for the group into a child process and executes the command. The variables are *not* exposed to your parent terminal session.

```bash
envseal run dev python app.py

```

### `envseal load <GROUP_NAME> [KEYS...]`

Loads the specified keys (or the entire group if keys are omitted) into the current terminal environment.
*Note: For security and scoping, use `run` for most use cases.*

```bash
# Loads the entire group into current shell (if shell integration is installed)
envseal load dev

# Loads specific keys
envseal load dev DATABASE_URL API_KEY

```

### `envseal list <GROUP_NAME>`

List all keys currently stored inside a specific group.

```bash
envseal list dev

```

### `envseal remove <GROUP_NAME> [KEY]`

Deletes a specific key from a group. If no key is provided, the **entire group** is deleted.

```bash
# Remove a single key
envseal remove dev OLD_API_KEY

# Delete the entire dev group
envseal remove dev

```

## Security

### Encryption Details

* **Cipher**: AES-256-GCM (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)
* **Key Derivation**: Argon2 (memory-hard password hashing)
* **Random Nonce**: 12-byte randomly generated nonce per encryption
* **Memory Safety**: Uses the `zeroize` crate to wipe sensitive data from memory immediately after use.

### Best Practices

* **Prefer `envseal run**`: Injecting secrets directly into child processes using `run` is significantly safer than using `load`, which leaves credentials hanging in your active terminal session.
* **Protect the Vault**: While the vault is encrypted, ensure your machine utilizes full-disk encryption and proper file permissions.

## Use Cases

### Local Development Across Environments

Instead of swapping `.env` files manually, store them in groups and run your app contextually:

```bash
# Initial setup
envseal import dev .env.dev
envseal import staging .env.staging
envseal import prod .env.prod

# Work on local dev
envseal run dev npm start

# Test against staging database
envseal run staging npm start

```

### CI/CD Pipeline Local Testing

Test your deployment scripts locally without hardcoding secrets:

```bash
envseal run deploy ./scripts/deploy_to_aws.sh

```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Vault not found" Error

**Problem**: `envseal: error: no vault found — run 'envseal init' first`
**Solution**: Run `envseal init` to create your initial encrypted vault.

### "No entry / group named X" Error

**Problem**: Trying to get, run, or list a group/key that doesn't exist.
**Solution**: Keys and groups are case-sensitive. Use `envseal list <GROUP_NAME>` to check the exact spelling.

### `envseal load` isn't setting environment variables

**Problem**: Running `envseal load GROUP` prints export statements but they don't seem to take effect.
**Solution**: This happens if the automatic shell wrapper wasn't installed. As an immediate workaround, evaluate the output manually:

```bash
eval "$(envseal load dev)"

```

Alternatively, switch to using `envseal run dev <command>`.
